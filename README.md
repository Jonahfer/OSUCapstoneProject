<h1>OSU Capstone Project - VR Arcade Classics</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This is a Capstone Project for Oregon State University, done in a team with my teammates Hannalore Morrow, Miguel Songco, and Michael Lagardera. The goal of the project is to recreate/reimagine classic arcade games into a VR expirience, 
with our focus being on Pac-Man and Frogger. The project uses Unity, primarly supporting VR for Oculus 2 Devices.

<h2>Languages and Utilities Used</h2>

- <b>C#</b> 
- <b>Unity Engine</b>
- <b>VR support for Oculus Devices</b>

<h2>My Specific Contributions in the Project</h2>
I am mainly responsible for developing a majority of the game logic for Frogger. Specifically:

- <b>logic for the obstacles (Cars, logs, Alligators, ect...)</b>
- <b>logic for handling the Player failing (getting hit by the cars, falling in water, ect..)</b>
- <b>logic for generating random and infinite layouts of obstacles for each playthrough</b>
- <b>logic for handling asset management during play</b>
